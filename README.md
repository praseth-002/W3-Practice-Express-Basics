reflection
1.	Saves time instead of writing complex logic yourself.
2.	Makes it easier to remove or add more in the future.
3.	I could add tokens for each roles and require certain features with the admin token.
4.	I would return an error describing why it happened. For the example given I would output min can not be higher than max.
5.	I could try to filter them by similarity than 1:1 match.
6.	I would assume having the token out in the open is not safe, a better approach could be to anonymize it.
7.	To ensure that the correct type of data is being enterd in the query.
8.	I would say yes I could reuse them although they are quite specefic. For packaging I am not sure, but for documentation I could write an explanation on top of the file.
9.	I can add into the route block for more filters in the query and also add more middleware to check them.
10.	I would assume it will slow the website down with high traffic and to solve that I would use rate limiting to not allow an influx of users in at once.
